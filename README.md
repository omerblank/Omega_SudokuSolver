# OmegaSudokuSolver
This is my second project in Omega course, in this project I will create a sudoku solver program in C#.
In this sudoku solver, you can enter a sudoku grid as a string or as a text file that includes a grid as a string.
a 9X9 grid as a string looks like this: "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
the first 9 chars are in the first row
the second 9 chars are in the second row
and so on...

Ω ENJOY! Ω
