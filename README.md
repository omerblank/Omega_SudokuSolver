# OmegaSudokuSolver

## Project In Short
This is my second project in Omega course, in this project I will create a sudoku solver program in C#.
In this sudoku solver, you can enter a sudoku grid as a string or as a text file that includes a grid as a string.
a 9X9 grid as a string looks like this: "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
the first 9 chars are in the first row
the second 9 chars are in the second row
and so on...
here you can check the basic rules of sudoku: https://www.kristanix.com/sudokuepic/sudoku-rules.php

## DancingLinks Algorithm

I chose to use the dancing links algorithm in this program.
the dancing links algorithm (DLX) was invented by donald knuth.
the algorithm is built to solve exact cover problems.
dlx uses sparse matrix and algorithm x to solve the exact cover problem.
here you can check some info about algorithm x and exact cover problem: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-exact-cover-problem-and-algorithm-x/

## Things I know i need to improve
1. when creating cover matrix, in the constraints functions, it would be a lot better if i was running on the dimensions of the source grid and not on the dimensions of the cover matrix.
2. gitignore file is not good because i pushed the unnecesary files in the beggining, i've learned from it and did it right in the Tests Repository.
3. git work was not perfect at all, a lot of unnecesary commits and pushes, struggling with merging.

Ω ENJOY! Ω
